# Mutli-node Kubernetes Cluster

This is all coded now, see [createcluster.sh](/src/createcluster.sh) and [versions.sh](/src/versions.sh).

## Create the Cluster

Creating the cluster is simple but we'll use the new user interface. The old way still works but the new way is more descriptive.

The new way:

```bash
mokctl create cluster myk8s --with-lb --masters 3 --workers 3
```

is equivalent to the old way:

```bash
mokctl create cluster myk8s --with-lb 3 3
```

For testing multi-master with a front-end load balancer for the master 'nodes' only:

```bash
mokctl create cluster myk8s --with-lb --masters 2 --workers 1
```

There is no limit to the number of workers or masters. The workers are set to talk to the load balancer 'node' rather than the masters, and the kubectl configuration file `/var/tmp/admin.conf` also points to the load balancer node. Then it's possible to see what happens when master node(s) are stopped and restarted.

For testing, say, pod placement strategies, only one master is required with no load balancer:

```bash
mokctl create cluster myk8s --masters 1 --workers 8
```

My laptop - Intel(R) Processor 5Y10 CPU @ 0.80GHz, with 8GB RAM has no problem running 9 kubernetes 'nodes'.

Here's the output from the previous command:

```bash
$ mokctl create cluster myk8s --masters 1 --workers 8
  ✓ Creating master container, 'myk8s-master-1'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-master-1'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-1'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-1'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-2'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-2'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-3'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-3'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-4'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-4'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-5'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-5'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-6'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-6'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-7'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-7'
  ✓ Creating worker container, 'myk8s-worker-8'
  ✓ Setting up 'myk8s-worker-8'

Cluster, "myk8s", can be accessed using:

export KUBECONFIG=/var/tmp/admin.conf

$
```

And the output from `kubectl`:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -A

The eighth worker did not get set up correctly. It could be fixed manually or the cluster deleted and the creation tried again. The worker nodes are created quite fast, so a delay, waiting until all services are started, would help here. As would being able to add and delete worker nodes after a cluster is built. On faster machines this might not be an issue until even larger clusters are created, so it does need fixing. Both suggested fixes are relatively straight forward to implement so when I need it I will do it, unless someone else does it first :)

That's it!

## What's Next

Next we learn how to Upgrade a cluster - TODO.
