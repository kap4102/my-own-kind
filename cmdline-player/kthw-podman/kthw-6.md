# Create encryption config and key

# We need to log back into the podman container, 'kthw', then
# paste the command blocks
podman exec -ti kthw bash

# The Encryption Key

# Set the encryption key variable
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)
echo $ENCRYPTION_KEY

# Need to be in the directory where the certs are so it can be
# copied from the host later on
cd /certs

# The Encryption Config File

# Copy the encryption-config.yaml encryption config file to each
# controller instance:

# We need to log out of this container then copy the encryption
# key to the kubernetes master nodes
exit
# The encryption key should be in the kthw-certs directory
ls kthw-certs/*.yaml
# It is, good! Let's have a quick look at it:
cat kthw-certs/*.yaml
# Now to copy it to the Masters:
# NOTE that 'sudo' is required as these are privileged containers
# that were created with 'sudo mokctl'.
cd kthw-certs
# Copy to the masters
for instance in kthw-master-1 kthw-master-2 kthw-master-3; do
  sudo podman cp encryption-config.yaml ${instance}:/root
done
# All done :)
